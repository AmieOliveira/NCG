# Connectivity Patterns in Neural Networks

This project was designed to evaluate the effect of 
using different connectivity patterns in a neural 
network performance. More specifically, it works 
with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), a model 
that can be understood as a feedforward neural 
network. This is a relatively simple model, 
containing only two layers (a visible and a hidden 
layer) and thus found ideal to start the research 
on connectivity.

> Provavelmente o ideal é colocar um link...

This code is designed to train both RBMs parameters 
and the connectivity between hidden and visible units 
simultaneously.

Note: Code developed in MacOS, with compiler Clang 
(version 12.0.5), using C++ 14.
